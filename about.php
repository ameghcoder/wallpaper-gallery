                                    <h3>Selfish Man</h3>
                                    <p style="font-size: 18px;">Now-a-days people become more selfish And it is right to
                                        become a selfish, Because if a man will be connected to everything around him,
                                        it is hard to leave them. So, if you want to get success in your life, you won't
                                        connect with everything around you. Only <span
                                            class="highlight-italic-text">meet them, spend time with them, and forget
                                            them.</span></p>
                                    <h3>What is Books ?</h3>
                                    <p style="font-size: 18px;">Books take away you beyond your think. Good Books are
                                        excites you to do something big in your life.</p>
                                    <h3>More About Books ...</h3>
                                    <p style="font-size : 18px">
                                        Everyone knows about books and also knows the main role of books in our entire
                                        life. When we are children, the books comes into our life as a giant virtual
                                        problem. Every child thinks, what the shit is this, child say to the mom,
                                        "Please save me, I don't want to study." Then Mom said that "Babu this is best
                                        for your good life and Books will help you in your entire life after me." And
                                        everyone knows that Moms never lie. Especially when she talks about your life.
                                        <br>
                                        I don't say that a book is everything in your life, But in every field to do
                                        something big you need at least a good book that make you a well behaved man and
                                        really a human. Becuase in real-world beyond science you never be a man with an
                                        only body, you always be a man with your behaviour. Now-a-days when you look
                                        around you, you find that today's environment makes that child more aggresive,
                                        because I think that only way to make you a good person is reading good books
                                        because books, only good books never make a person aggresive, only make a human
                                        being.
                                    </p>
                                    <h3>Love</h3>
                                    <p style="font-size: 18px;">
                                        Perhaps everyone has a love life in their life. Everyone knows that today's love
                                        is not real love. They only want a girl for their use in any way. Only a few
                                        people do really love her. But Now-a-days the environment and good think both
                                        are destroyed slowly. If you really want to know the meaning of real love,
                                        Filter your thoughts about girls.
                                    </p>
